This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- - Edge left/right are formatted wrong when ln is deleted on left side of screen and line.length < CHARS_ON_SCREEN
- Visual design improvements
- Rewriting inefficient code
- Add buttons to let user decide height and width?
- - Refractor so that ROWS_ON_SCREEN is a constants
- Reset PX amounts to be relative to calculator borders?
