This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- Visual design improvements
- Rewriting inefficient code
- Gotta fix sqrt and ^ when they are on the left side of the screen
