This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- - ln() disappears the screen if it is in the last three spots and the line doesn't reach that far
- - deleting multiple items seems to move the edges sometimes when it shouldn't
- - Shouldn't be able to copy infinity, or NaN
- Visual design improvements
- Rewriting inefficient code
