This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- - deleting multiple items seems to move the edges sometimes when it shouldn't
- - This happens most near the left side of the screen
- - Deleting when edgeLeft === 0 moves edgeRight without moving edgeLeft
- Visual design improvements
- Rewriting inefficient code
- Could I have the ability to click at different parts of the displayed line?
