This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Deleting ln puts the cursor at the wrong spot
- Deleting parentheses attached to special operation should delete operation too

Things on the list:
- Evaluate user line function
- Make keyboard buttons work?
