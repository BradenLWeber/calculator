This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Button up/down screen
- - Make buttons into shape of up/down arrows?
- - Have arrows both above the screen?
- Fix incompatibility with some devices
- - Is it an issue of using absolute position when it whould be relative?
