This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- - Should limit the amount that can be put into a line
- Visual design improvements
- Rewriting inefficient code
- Add buttons to let user decide height and width?
- - Refractor so that ROWS_ON_SCREEN is a constant
- Reset PX amounts to be relative to calculator borders?
