This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- - Sometimes when ln and sqrt are deleted from the very left of the screen, the line doesn't correct itself
- Visual design improvements
- Rewriting inefficient code
- Run Prettier?
- Add buttons to let user decide height and width?
