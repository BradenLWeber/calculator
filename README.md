This is a browser calculator and my first full-fledged React App!

I am not breaking any new ground here, but the practical application of the things I have been learning is important.

Things next:
- Bug hunt!
- - Scrolls up one away from the top in one case
- Add buttons to let user decide height and width
- - Is there some way to make these buttons look nicer?
- Button up/down screen
- - Make buttons into shape of up/down arrows?
- - Have arrows both above the screen?
